Project Development:
 ● Createareduxstore:
 1. `import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";`: This line imports the
 `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit is a package that provides
 utilities to simplify Redux development, making it easier to write Redux logic with less
 boilerplate code.
 2. `import { cryptoApi } from "../services/cryptoApi";`: This line imports the
 `cryptoApi` object from the `cryptoApi.js` file located in the `../services` directory.
This object likely contains configurations and functions related to making API requests
 for cryptocurrency data.
 3. `export default configureStore({ ... });`: This line exports the Redux store
 configuration created by the `configureStore` function as the default export of this
 module.
 4. `reducer: { [cryptoApi.reducerPath]: cryptoApi.reducer }`: This part of the
 configuration specifies the root reducer for the Redux store. In this case, it sets the
 `cryptoApi.reducer` as the reducer for the slice of state managed by the `cryptoApi`
 API slice. The `cryptoApi.reducerPath` likely refers to the slice's unique identifier,
 which is used internally by Redux Toolkit.
 5. `middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
 getDefaultMiddleware().concat(cryptoApi.middleware),`: This part of the configuration
 specifies middleware for the Redux store. Middleware intercepts actions before they
 reach the reducers and can be used for various purposes, such as logging,
 asynchronous actions, or handling API requests. Here, it uses the
 `getDefaultMiddleware` function provided by Redux Toolkit to get the default
 middleware stack and appends the `cryptoApi.middleware`. This middleware likely
 handles asynchronous API requests and dispatches corresponding actions based on
 the API response.
 this configuration sets up a Redux store with a specific reducer and middleware
 provided by the `cryptoApi` object, which presumably manages state related to
 cryptocurrency data fetched from an external API. This setup allows you to manage and
 interact with this data using Redux within your React application.
● CreateaAPIsliceusingReduxtoolkit’s:
 1. Import Statements:- `import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from "@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react";`: This
 line imports the necessary functions from Redux Toolkit's query-related module.
 `createApi` is used to create an API slice, while `fetchBaseQuery` is a utility function
 provided by Redux Toolkit for making network requests using `fetch`.
 2. Header and Base URLConfiguration:- `const cryptoApiHeaders = { ... }`: This object contains headers required for making
 requests to the cryptocurrency API. The values for `"X-RapidAPI-Key"` and
 `"X-RapidAPI-Host"` are retrieved from environment variables using
 `import.meta.env`.- `const baseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_URL;`: This variable holds the base
 URLfor the cryptocurrency API, which is also retrieved from environment variables.
 3. Request Creation Function:- `const createRequest = (url) => ({ url, headers: cryptoApiHeaders });`: This function
 `createRequest` takes a URL and returns an object with the URL and headers required
 for making a request. It utilizes `cryptoApiHeaders` to include necessary headers in
 the request.
4. Create API Slice:- `export const cryptoApi = createApi({ ... })`: This part uses the `createApi` function
 to create an API slice named `cryptoApi`. It takes an object with several properties:- `reducerPath`: Specifies the path under which the slice's reducer will be mounted
 in the Redux store.- `baseQuery`: Configures the base query function used by the API slice. In this
 case, it uses `fetchBaseQuery` with the base URL specified.- `endpoints`: Defines the API endpoints available in the slice. It's an object with
 keys corresponding to endpoint names and values being endpoint definitions.
 5. API Endpoints:- `getCryptos`, `getCryptoDetails`, `getCryptoHistory`: These are endpoints
 defined using the `builder.query` method. Each endpoint is configured with a `query`
 function that returns the request configuration object created by `createRequest`.
 6. Exporting Hooks:- `export const { ... }`: This line exports hooks generated by the `createApi` function,
 allowing components to easily fetch data from the API slice. Each hook corresponds to
 an endpoint defined in the `endpoints` object.
 Overall, this code sets up an API slice named `cryptoApi` using Redux Toolkit's query
 functionality. It defines endpoints for fetching cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency details,
 and cryptocurrency history. The slice is configured with base URL, headers, and query
 functions required for making requests to the cryptocurrency API.
● AddingProvidersinthemainfunction:
 React Router with `BrowserRouter`:- `<BrowserRouter>`: This component is provided by `react-router-dom` and
 enables client-side routing using the HTML5 history API. It wraps the application,
 allowing it to use routing features.
 Redux Provider:
- `<Provider store={store}>`: This component is provided by `react-redux` and is
 used to provide the Redux store to the entire application. It wraps the application,
 allowing all components to access the Redux store.
 Overall, this code initializes the React application by rendering the root component
 (`<App />`) into the DOM, while also providing routing capabilities through
 `BrowserRouter` and state management with Redux through `Provider`. Additionally,
 it ensures stricter development mode checks with `<React.StrictMode>`.
 ● CreatingaLinechartcomponent:
 This code defines a React component called `LineChart` which renders a line chart
 using the `react-chartjs-2` library.
 1. Imports:- `import React from "react";`: Imports the `React` module.- `import { Line } from "react-chartjs-2";`: Imports the `Line` component from the
 `react-chartjs-2` library, which is used to render line charts.
- `import { Col, Row, Typography } from "antd";`: Imports specific components from
 the Ant Design library, including `Col`, `Row`, and `Typography`.- `const { Title } = Typography;`: Destructures the `Title` component from the
 `Typography` module.
 2. Component Definition:- `const LineChart = ({ coinHistory, currentPrice, coinName }) => { ... }`: Defines a
 functional component called `LineChart`. It takes three props: `coinHistory`,
 `currentPrice`, and `coinName`.
 3. Data Preparation:- Inside the component, it loops through the `coinHistory` data to extract
 `coinPrice` and `coinTimestamp` arrays. These arrays will be used as data points for
 the line chart.
 4. Chart Data:- `const data = { ... }`: Defines the data object for the line chart. It includes labels
 (timestamps) and datasets (coin prices).
 5. Rendering:- Inside the return statement, it renders the chart header, including the coin name,
 price change, and current price.- `Row`and`Col`fromAntDesignareusedtostructure the layout.- The `Line` component renders the actual line chart using the data object defined
 earlier.
 6. Export:- `export default LineChart;`: Exports the `LineChart` component as the default
 export.
Overall, this component receives historical data (`coinHistory`), current price
 (`currentPrice`), and the name of the cryptocurrency (`coinName`) as props, and
 renders a line chart displaying the historical price data. It also includes additional
 information such as the price change and current price displayed above the chart.
● Creatingcryptocurrencies component:
 1. Component Definition:- `const Cryptocurrencies = ({ simplified }) => { ... }`: Defines a functional component
 named`Cryptocurrencies`. It accepts a prop named `simplified`, which determines
 whether to display a simplified version of the list.
 2. Initialization:- `const count = simplified ? 10 : 100;`: Initializes the `count` variable based on the
 value of the `simplified` prop. If `simplified` is true, `count` is set to 10; otherwise,
 it's set to 100.
 3. Fetching Cryptocurrency Data:- `const { data: cryptosList, isFetching } = useGetCryptosQuery(count);`: Uses the
 `useGetCryptosQuery` hook provided by the `cryptoApi` service to fetch
 cryptocurrency data. It retrieves the list of cryptocurrencies (`cryptosList`) and a
 boolean flag (`isFetching`) indicating whether the data is being fetched.
 4. Filtering Cryptocurrency Data:- The `useEffect` hook is used to filter the cryptocurrency data based on the
 `searchTerm` state variable. It updates the `cryptos` state with filtered data
 whenever `cryptosList` or `searchTerm` changes.
 5. Rendering Loader:- `if (isFetching) return <Loader />;`: If data is still being fetched (`isFetching` is
 true), it returns a `Loader` component to indicate that the data is loading.
 6. Rendering Search Input:- `!simplified && (...)`: If `simplified` is false, it renders a search input field allowing
 users to search for specific cryptocurrencies by name.
 7. Rendering Cryptocurrency Cards:
- The `Row`and`Col`componentsfromAntDesignareusedtocreate a grid layout
 for displaying cryptocurrency cards.- For each cryptocurrency in the `cryptos` array, it renders a `Card` component
 containing details such as name, price, market cap, and daily change. Each card is
 wrapped in a `Link` component, allowing users to navigate to the details page of a
 specific cryptocurrency.
 8. Return Statement:- `return (...)`: Returns JSX representing the component's structure and content.
 Overall, this component fetches cryptocurrency data, filters it based on a search term,
 and renders the data in a visually appealing format with card-based UI. It also provides
 a search functionality for users to find specific cryptocurrencies.

● Createacomponenttoshowthedetailsofcryptocurrency:
 This code defines a React functional component called `CryptoDetails` responsible for
 displaying detailed information about a specific cryptocurrency. Let's break down the
 code:
 1. Component Definition:- `const CryptoDetails = () => { ... }`: Defines a functional component named
 `CryptoDetails`. It doesn't accept any props directly but utilizes React Router's
 `useParams` hook to get the `coinId` parameter from the URL.
 2. State Initialization:- Initializes state variables `timePeriod` and `coinHistory`. `timePeriod` represents
 the selected time period for displaying cryptocurrency history, and `coinHistory`
 stores historical data of the selected cryptocurrency.
 3. Fetching Data:- Utilizes `useGetCryptoDetailsQuery` and `useGetCryptoHistoryQuery` hooks
 provided by the `cryptoApi` service to fetch details and historical data of the
 cryptocurrency specified by `coinId`. It uses `coinId` obtained from `useParams` to
 fetch data for the specific cryptocurrency.
 4. Setting Coin History:- Utilizes `useEffect` hook to update the `coinHistory` state when
 `coinHistoryData` changes. This ensures that the component re-renders with updated
 historical data.
 5. Rendering Loader:- Displays a loading indicator (`<Loader />`) while data is being fetched (`isFetching`
 is true).
6. Time Period Selection:- Renders a `Select` component allowing users to choose the time period for
 displaying historical data. It triggers the `setTimePeriod` function when the selection
 changes.
 7. Rendering Line Chart:- Utilizes the `LineChart` component to display the historical price trend of the
 cryptocurrency over the selected time period.
